# Summary

This is a mounting bracket for the HC-SR04 sonar range finder.  This bracket is designed to have the rangefinder snap into place and protect the sensor from shorts.  The bracket has two mounting holes the perfect size for #6-32 screws, although the size of the holes can be enlarged considerably with a drill.  I designed the part in inches with the intention to scale the part by 25.4, but have found that if you scale it by 26 you have the best results.  To protect your rangefinder further, I made sure there was enough space to insert a piece of a foam paper plate cut to size to help with vibration.  The bracket completely covers the back of the rangefinder, allowing you to mount it directly onto metal without having to worry about shorts.  Tips are welcome! I am a college student and every dollar goes a long way in furthering my education.



# Instructions

I used a Prusa i3 with PLA filament at a .2mm layer height and it printed in around 30 minutes.  The sensor easily snaps in the bracket without the need of screws.  If you cut a piece of a foam paper plate to put behind the sensor it helps considerably with vibration if you are using this with a robot.  Scale the part by 26 if you use PLA and slightly more if you are using ABS.
